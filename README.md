# 📈 Time Series Stock Forecasting

A data analytics project to analyze and forecast stock market trends using Time Series models like **ARIMA**, **Prophet**, and **LSTM**.

> 🔍 Built as part of the **Zidio Team-15 Internship Project** — this project demonstrates predictive modeling, data visualization, and deep learning applied to real-world stock market data.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Understand time series components: **trend**, **seasonality**, **noise**
- Forecast future stock prices using:
  - ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
  - Prophet (Facebook’s time series forecasting model)
  - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks)
- Visualize and compare model performance
- Prepare a deployable pipeline for stock market prediction
